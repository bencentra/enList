# ideal-list

A collaborative list editing web app with a silly name. To be (re)written in several languages/libraries for practice.

## Attempt #1 - December 2016

### Server - Python + [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/)

__Why?__
* It appears to be very lightweight
* It supports async networking (e.g. websockets) out of the box

### Client - JavaScript + [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org)

__Why?__
* [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/) will be a standard one day
* Polymer provides additional features beyond a polyfill

## Future Attempts

* Server: Node.js + Express + WebSockets
* Server: Java? (go enterprise!)
* Client: JavaScript + React
* Client: Elm? (go functional!)
